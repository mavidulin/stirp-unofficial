#**STIRP Web map (Forrest Classification)**

Interactive map with base layers, wms layers requested from GeoServer of forrests and administrative units of Croatia. 
Project was done in educational purposes with team of four students.

##_Forest units_

Forest units are obtained by observing the forest areas from satellites. In classification we are not using NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index), than FAPAR (Fraction of Absorbed Photosynthetically Active Radiation). Results of classification are compared with forest maps that contain more than 50 years old data. Results of classification are excellent.
